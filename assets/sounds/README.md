# Halloween Game Sound Effects

This directory contains sound files for the Halloween game:

## Required Sound Files:
- `background_music.mp3` - Spooky background soundtrack (looping)
- `jump_scare.mp3` - Jump scare sound for trap items
- `success.mp3` - Success sound when finding the correct item
- `boo.mp3` - Ghost sound effect
- `cackle.mp3` - Witch cackling sound

## Note:
For this demo, we'll use Flutter's built-in SystemSound for now.
You can replace these with actual Halloween sound files later.
